- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  To evaluate when the loop should run and to stop when this condition becomes false.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  It is evaluated at the very beginning of the loop, before it starts running.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  After the initial expression is evaluated, before the loop starts running. It must evaluate to true in order for the loop to run.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  It is evaluated once the condition is met and the loop executes once., which tells the loops whether to continue running or not, depending on whether the condition is true.
